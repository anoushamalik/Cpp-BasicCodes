### 1- Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
This program simulates a classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game between two players.
### How It Works
Input: Each player is prompted to enter their choice using numbers:

1 for Rock, 
2 for Paper, 
3 for Scissors.
### Output:
If both players choose the same option, the game results in a tie.
Rock beats Scissors.
Scissors beat Paper.
Paper beats Rock.
Invalid Input: 
If either player enters a number outside the range 1-3, the program will display an error message indicating that the input is invalid.

### 2- Palindrome Checker
This program checks if a given number is a palindrome. A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward.
### How It Works
Input: The user is prompted to enter a number.
Processing: The program calculates the reverse of the given number and compares it to the original number to determine if it is a palindrome.

### Output:
The reverse of the entered number is displayed.
The program indicates whether the number is a palindrome or not.

### 3- Ceiling Value Calculator
This program computes the ceiling value of a floating-point number entered by the user. The ceiling of a number is the smallest integer greater than or equal to that number.

### How It Works
Input: The user is prompted to enter a floating-point number.
Processing: The program uses the ceil() function from the <cmath> library to calculate the ceiling value of the given number.

### Output:

The program displays the ceiling value of the entered number.

### 4-Shape Identifier
This program takes the coordinates of four points as input and determines whether the points form a square, rectangle, or parallelogram.

### How It Works
Input: 
The user is prompted to enter the coordinates of four points in the Cartesian plane.
Processing:
The program calculates the lengths of the four sides formed by these points using the distance formula.
It then checks:
If opposite sides are equal, the points form a rectangle or parallelogram.
If all sides are equal, the points form a square.

### Output:
The program will display whether the points form a square, rectangle, or parallelogram.
